			<h1>What I Learned</h1>
			<h1>2022-2023</h1>
		</div>

		<p>In spring 2023, I taught myself how to code, specifically in web development. I knew very basic coding from my homeschool curriculum, EP, but this year, I decided to learn more.</p>
		<p>To show what I learned for my 2023 school year evaluation, I thought what better idea than to create a website featuring all of my skills! I plan to make one of these every year, each new site better than the previous one.</p>
		<p>This year was my learning curve year, where I was exposed to many new concepts in web development and gave me a new perspective and respect for people who create websites - it's hard!</p>
		<p>For me, the hardest part about coding was keeping myself <i>organized</i>. I would get confused with what goes to what and what everything does. That's why most of the projects I started never got finished.</p>
		<p>Anyway, this spring, I learned the following languages:</p>

	
	<div class="flex-container">

		<div class="box html-box">
			<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank">HTML</a></p>
			<p>The HyperText Markup Language</p>
			<p>Used to construct the skeletal structure of a webpage. Files can end in <b>.html</b> or <b>.htm</b></p>
		</div>
	
			<div class="box css-box">
				<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="_blank">CSS</a></p>
				<p>Cascading Style Sheets</p>
				<p>Used to enhance the aesthetic appearance of a webpage. Files end in <b>.css</b></p>
			</div>
	
				<div class="box js-box">
					<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a></p>
					<p>Makes websites interactive with a number of statements using html elements. Files end in <b>.js</b> </p>
				</div>
		
	</div>
	

		<p>I also learned a little bit of <b>Python</b>, a popular backend scripting language. I can't make anything useful yet, but I did make a non-playable console game.
		I picked up the syntax pretty easily (i.e. the way you write the language) due to my prior knowledge of JavaScript.</p>
		
		<p>I feel pretty content with my progress in HTML and CSS, although I don't like how nuanced they are (primarily CSS). I faced an especially challenging issue I had to fix while constructing 
		this website regarding CSS specificity, but I debugged it after some research. Another challenge I had while making this website specifically was making a reusable navigation bar. The browser 
		doesn't just <em>know</em> that the navigation bar must be included on every page. After days of searching for a solution, I settled for <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> tags.</p>
		
		<p>I learned this wasn't the <em>best</em> way to do this (according to the internet, the most widely accepted method is using another language such as PHP. But I literally was scrambling 
		for a solution the day before my evaluation, so it's what I settled for.</p>
		
		<p>I haven't gone very far in JavaScript, but I know about different variables and functions. I also learned how to change the attributes ("styles") that CSS gives an element using JS.</p>
		
		<p>P.S.: If you ever try to learn CSS, learn <em>why</em> it's called <b>Cascading</b> Style Sheets. Master specificity and inheritance, and also learn about the box model. Taking the time to learn these will make bugs in your website less mysterious.</p>
		<p>P.P.S.: Also, refrain from using <code>!<span style="display: inline; background-color: #00b300">important</span></code> in your CSS code.

			<p>I've created lots of websites this spring, but only a few of them are good for their purpose. Honestly, I'd say this website has been my best project so far. But
			I'll show you two of my other ones, including:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>How Plants Grow</li>
				<li>Clicker Game</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p><img id="hpg-home-page" src="../images/how-plants-grow-home-page.png" alt="How Plants Grow home page" width="300px" height="300px">First, How Plants Grow. This was the first "real" website I made. I started making it this spring when I started learning to code. I'm not a botanist, and this wouldn't be the 
			theme I would go for if I <i>really</i> wanted to make a good website, but I needed something to base it off on, so I chose plants.</p>
			<p>In How Plants Grow, all I did was made an HTML document for the plant of my choosing, and then I would write about it.</p>
			
			<img id="hpg-bean-plant" src="../images/how-plants-grow-bean-plant.png" alt="How Plants Grow bean plant article" width="300px" height="300px">
			
			<p>It's a pretty basic website, so looking back on it, I'm not very proud of it. But it is special because it was my first project with a functional navigation bar.</p>

			<p>I have lots of things I want to learn. First, I'd need to fully master CSS. I am yet to master flexbox, grid, @media queries, and other CSS features.
			While doing this, I'll learn more JavaScript.</p>
			<p>The ideal would be to learn every single language, but that would take way too much time. I think I would get a good foundation in JavaScript, and then learn about servers.
			I would learn how to submit data from HTML forms (if you don't know what those are, I made a simple one below) using server-side languages such as PHP, Python, and the Structured Query Language, or SQL (also pronounced "sequel").
			I'll learn how to make different queries to the databases and have code written for every query. This would be my deep-dive into backend programming. I would move on from there.</p>
			
			<h1 style="text-align: center;">An HTML Form</h1>
			
			<form class="dummy-form" action="#">
			
				<fieldset>
					<label>Username: <input type="text" placeholder="Username" required></label><br>
					<label>Email: <input type="email" placeholder="john.doe@example.com" required></label><br>
					<label>Password: <input type="password" name="password" minlength="5" placeholder="At least 5 characters" required></label>
				</fieldset>
				<fieldset>
					<label><input type="checkbox" required>I accept the <a onclick="dummyTermsAndConditionsALERT()" class="terms-and-conditions" href="#">terms and conditions</a></label>
				</fieldset>
				
				<button type="submit">Submit</button>
				
			</form>
		
			<p><b>Update from July 7, 2023:</b> I have a good understanding of CSS media queries now, and I even implemented them in this site. There screen will now change
			when the screen is 610px wide or less.</p>
